# Using-Inheritance-with-Dynamically-Created-Objects
This C++ project represents a Manager Payroll System that allows you to manage and calculate the pay for managers in a company. It's designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic memory allocation.

The manager class if derived from the employee class.

The main program allows you to interact with the Manager class.
It declares an array of pointers to Manager objects to store information about multiple managers.
Users are prompted to enter the number of managers and, for each manager, provide details such as name, wage, hours worked, and bonus.
It dynamically creates Manager objects using C++'s new operator and stores pointers to these objects in an array.
